To be sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them grabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying, &ldquo;I complain of so-and-so;&rdquo; but what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.</p></div> </div>
