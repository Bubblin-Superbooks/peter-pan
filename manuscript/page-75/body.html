<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask each other&rsquo;s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to ask him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what you want to be asked is Kings of England.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied uneasily, &ldquo;but I am quite young.&rdquo; He really knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a venture, &ldquo;Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.&rdquo;</p><p>Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he could sit nearer her.</p></div> </div>
