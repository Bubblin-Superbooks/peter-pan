Begone from me for ever.&rdquo;</p><p>She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say, &ldquo;Well, not for ever, but for a whole week.&rdquo;</p><p>Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh dear no, never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange, and Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed [slapped] them.</p></div> </div>
