It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael&rsquo;s bath and carrying him to it on her back.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go to bed,&rdquo; he had shouted, like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t.
