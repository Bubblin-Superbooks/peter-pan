<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;To return to the ship,&rdquo; Hook replied slowly through his teeth, &ldquo;and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it. There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids&rsquo; Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no mother, they don&rsquo;t know how dangerous &lsquo;tis to eat rich damp cake.&rdquo; He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. &ldquo;Aha, they will die.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
