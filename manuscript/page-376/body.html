Hook tried to hearten them; but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Lads,&rdquo; he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never quailing for an instant, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought it out. There&rsquo;s a Jonah aboard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; they snarled, &ldquo;a man wi&rsquo; a hook.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, lads, no, it&rsquo;s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi&rsquo; a woman on board. We&rsquo;ll right the ship when she&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
