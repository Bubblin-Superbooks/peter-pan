<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom&rsquo;s school where the nurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling&rsquo;s friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael&rsquo;s pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John&rsquo;s hair.</p><p>No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked.</p></div> </div>
