Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.</p><p>&ldquo;Lads,&rdquo; he cried to his crew, &ldquo;now here&rsquo;s a notion. Open the cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If they kill him, we&rsquo;re so much the better; if he kills them, we&rsquo;re none the worse.&rdquo;</p><p>For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them.</p></div> </div>
