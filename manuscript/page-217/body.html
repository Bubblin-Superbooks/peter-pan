<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.</p><p>Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down, Peter&rsquo;s and Wendy&rsquo;s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was two against one that angered him, and he meant to save her. An easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never one to choose the easy way.</p></div> </div>
