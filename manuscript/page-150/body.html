Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo&rsquo;sun the story of his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.</p><p>Anon [later] he caught the word Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Most of all,&rdquo; Hook was saying passionately, &ldquo;I want their captain, Peter Pan. &lsquo;Twas he cut off my arm.&rdquo; He brandished the hook threateningly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I&rsquo;ll tear him!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
