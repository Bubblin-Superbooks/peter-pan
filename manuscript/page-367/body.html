The children gazed at each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They followed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song, his dogs joining in with him:</p><p>&ldquo;Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat, Its tails are nine, you know, And when they&rsquo;re writ upon your back&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship, and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.</p></div> </div>
