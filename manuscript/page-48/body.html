You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.&rdquo;</p><p>Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana&rsquo;s mouth, he had said reprovingly, &ldquo;Be a man, Michael.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t; won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness.</p></div> </div>
