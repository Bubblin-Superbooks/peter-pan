<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life, The flag o&rsquo; skull and bones, A merry hour, a hempen rope, And hey for Davy Jones.&rdquo;</p><p>At once the lost boys&mdash;but where are they? They are no longer there. Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.</p><p>I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has darted away to reconnoitre [look around], they are already in their home under the ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently. But how have they reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy.</p></div> </div>
